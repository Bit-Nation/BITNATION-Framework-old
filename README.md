# BITNATION framework

Welcome to the BITNATION framework!

The following is a framework to let you create nearly any kind of entity in the ethereum blockchain, example of such entities include:
 -  a Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN)
 -  a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
 -  a tool to manage your personal funds
 -  a union, like a marriage or a co-living agreement 
 -  a holon, embassy or a consulate
 -  ... (put yours here :wink:)

The framework is made of smart contracts in solidity. We put a big amount of work into making it upgradeable, which is quite rare in the ethereum world.
